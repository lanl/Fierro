                <h1>GUI Guide</h1>
                <p>
                    The <em>Fierro</em> graphical interface is designed to give a simple interface for the most
                    common use cases. This guide describes the steps for running <em>Fierro</em> dynamics evolution 
                    simulations from this GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>1. Generating a mesh</h2>
                <p>
                    A mesh is a (potentially non-uniform) spatial grid on which computation takes place. This is layer is connected with, but
                    distinct from the model geometry (which is also sometimes referred to as a "mesh"). Our GUI offers options for either creating 
                    a generic, regular, rectilinear grid mesh if you don't have one, or for laoding a mesh (.geo file) if you do. For best results,
                    we recommend using an external meshing program to create a .geo mesh file for your specific geometry.
                </p>
                <h2>2. Selecting a Geometry</h2>
                <p>
                    After selecting a mesh, you can load a model geometry (.stl) from your computer. The model geometry will define a volume
                    that can have a material assigned to it. After you select a geometry file, you will be prompted to specify a voxel resolution.
                    This is used for rasterizing the geometry into the underlying mesh.
                </p>
                <h2>3. Assigning Material Properties</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have a mesh and geometry loaded, you can then create and assign materials to regions of the mesh.
                    First, you create the materials that you might want to use and specify the material properties. 
                    Then, on the next window you can assign those materials either to the background mesh or to the voxelized volume.
                </p>
                <h2>4. Specifying Boundary Conditions</h2>
                <p>
                    You should now see a window where your voxelized geometry is being rendered. You can now add boundary conditions
                    to the system and view all current boundaries in the geometry viewer.
                </p>
                <h2>5. Solver Settings</h2>
                <p>
                    The last step before running <em>Fierro</em> is to check the solver settings. Here you can edit how long the solver should run
                    in simulated time, as well as control some of the bounds for timestepping.
                </p>
                <h2>6. Run &amp; View</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have your problem configured correctly, you can run <em>Fierro</em>. This will invoke the back-end programs, giving
                    you intermediate information about the progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the execution is finished, you are able to open the resulting evolution in <a href="https://www.paraview.org/">ParaView</a>
                        directly from the GUI.
