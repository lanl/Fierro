# Fierro
**Fierro** (LANL code number C21030) is a modern C++ code designed to simulate quasi-static solid mechanics problems and transient, compressible material dynamic problems with Lagrangian methods, which have meshes with constant mass elements that move with the material, or with Eulerian methods, which have stationary meshes.  **Fierro** is designed to aid a) material model research that has historically been done using commercial implicit and explicit finite element codes, b) numerical methods research, and c) computer science research.  The linear Lagrangian finite element methods in **Fierro** supports user developed material models.  **Fierro** is built on the **ELEMENTS** library that supports a diverse suite of element types, including high-order elements, and quadrature rules. The mesh class within the **ELEMENTS** library is designed for efficient calculations on unstructured meshes and to minimize memory usage.  **Fierro** is designed to readily accommodate a range of numerical methods including continuous finite element, finite volume, and discontinuous Galerkin methods.  **Fierro** is designed to support explicit and implicit time integration methods as well as implicit optimization methods.  


## Computer implementation
**Fierro** is implemented in C++ following modern programming practices.  **Fierro** leverages the unique features of the **ELEMENTS** library, as such, this code serves as an example for solving a system of partial differential equations using the mesh class and geometric functions within the **ELEMENTS** library.  **Fierro** registers state at material points within the element, registers polynomial fields in the element, and registers kinematic variables at element vertices.  The routines for the state are designed for highly efficient computations and to minimize memory usage.  The loops are written to aid fine-grained parallelization and to allow vectorization. **Fierro** is a light-weight software application, and cleanly written following modern programming practices, so it useful for researching computer science based technologies for software performances portability.  

## Spatial discretization methods 
**Fierro** has an established conservative low-order Lagrangian finite element method, a low-order Lagrangian cell-centered finite volume method, and an arbitrary-order Lagrangian Discontinuous Galerkin method for solving the governing equations (e.g., mass, momentum, and energy evolution equations) for compressible material dynamics using unstructured hexahedral meshes.  These methods are combined with a multidirectional approximate Riemann solver (MARS) for improved accuracy on smooth flows and stable solutions near velocity discontinuities and large gradients in a flow. **Fierro** is designed for both low and high-order Lagrangian methods research and development but other types of numerical methods can be readily added to the code.  Likewise, other high-order methods can be studied within the code because it is built upon the **ELEMENTS** library that supports high-order elements and high-order quadrature rules.  Numerical methods are being added to **Fierro** to simulate quasi-static solid mechanics problems.  Likewise, direct Eulerian hydrodynamic methods can be investigated using **Fierro**.

## Temporal discretization methods 
**Fierro** supports a range of published multi-step time integration methods. The code has an explicit multi-step Runge Kutta time integration method. Implicit time integration methods can be implemented in **Fierro**.

# Usage
## Anaconda
The recommended way to use **Fierro** is through the provided Anaconda package. To use the anaconda package, follow the steps for your platform to install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)/[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)/[mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). 

Open a terminal on your machine and go to a folder where you want to run the **Fierro** code.  Then create and activate an Anaconda environment by typing:  
```
conda create -n FierroCode
conda activate FierroCode  
```
In this example, the enviroment is called FierroCode, but any name can be used.  In some cases, the text to activate an enviroment is `source activate FierroCode`.  Likewise, if an enviroment already exists, then just activate the desired environment.  

To install the finite element physics solvers in **Fierro**, please type within the activated Anaconda environment:
```
conda install -c conda-forge -c fierromechanics fierro-fe-cpu
```
The EVPFFT physics solver in **Fierro** can be installed by typing:
```
conda install -c conda-forge -c fierromechanics fierro-evpfft-cpu
```
A GUI is offered, it can be installed by typing:
```
conda install -c conda-forge -c fierromechanics fierro-gui
```

After installing the finite element solvers, it gives you access to `fierro-mesh-builder`,`fierro-parallel-explicit`,`fierro-parallel-implicit`, and the `fierro-voxelizer` executables. These can be run by calling the appropriate executable with the desired input. For example, to call the parallel explicit hydrodynamics solver, use the following command:
```
fierro-parallel-explicit input.yaml
```
Sample yaml input files for the explicit finite element solver can be found at:
`./src/Parallel-Solvers/Parallel-Explicit/Example_Yaml_Scripts`

The implicit solver and topology optimization modules can be called using:
```
fierro-parallel-implicit input.yaml
```

Sample yaml input files for the implicit finite element solver and topology optimization problem setups can be found at:
`./src/Parallel-Solvers/Implicit-Lagrange/Example_Yaml_Scripts`

The GUI can be run in the anaconda enviroment by typing:
```
fierro-gui
```
The anaconda distributions of Fierro are located [here](https://anaconda.org/FierroMechanics).



## Material models
The classical ideal gas model is the only material model implemented in the code, and it is useful for verification tests of the software and simple gas dynamic simulations. The linear Lagrangian finite element methods for explicit material dynamics have an interface to user developed material models. The interface is to enable **Fierro** to be used for model research and development that has historically been done with commercial explicit finite element codes. 

To include your own custom material models, you need to implement them under `Fierro/Parallel-Solvers/User-Material-Interface` and re-build the project.
Steps:
1. Create an anaconda environment for your build
2. Install **Fierro** anaconda dependencies with `conda install elements fierro-trilinos-cpu elements -c fierromechanics`
3. [Clone the code](#cloning-the-code)
4. [Build the code](#building-the-code)

Now, if all went correctly, you should be able to run your custom **Fierro** build by calling the executable located at `Fierro/build/bin/fierro`. The executables can be installed into your system directories with the `make install` command as well.

# Cloning the code
If the user has set up ssh keys with GitHub, type
```
git clone --recursive ssh://git@github.com/lanl/Fierro.git
```
The code can also be cloned using
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lanl/Fierro.git
```

# Building the code
Building the code from source allows you to compile with more targeted hardware optimizations that could offer a potentially faster executable. 
To build it yourself, run the following from the root directory. The native CPU architecture will automatically be taken into account. 

GPU hardware will be leveraged according to the distribution of Trilinos that **Fierro** is built against.
You are welcome to only compile the desired solver, or all of the currently available ones. 

## Building dependencies
**Fierro** depends on both ELEMENTS and Trilinos. If you are building **Fierro** for hardware optimizations, you should also build ELEMENTS from source. ELEMENTS is included in the **Fierro** source distribution and building ELEMENTS is enabled by default when building **Fierro**.

As for Trilinos, we recommend installing the Anaconda package for the desired build into a new Anaconda environment to satisfy **Fierro**'s dependency rather than building it from source. If you do wish to build it from source, however, sample build scripts for Trilinos can be found in `Fierro/Trilinos-Build-Scripts`. Build scripts for all Anaconda packages can be found in `Fierro/Anaconda-Packages/`.

## Alternative Build Workflows
In addition to the primary build workflow described above, there are build scripts for a variety of alternative workflows. These scripts can be found under `Fierro/scripts`. Although there are multiple scripts shown in this directory, the only one that will be run directly by the user is ***build-fierro.sh***
### Building the explicit and implicit Lagrangian methods with Trilinos+Kokkos
Explicit Lagrangian codes are being added to the repository that are written using MATAR+Kokkos and run with fine-grained parallellism on multi-core CPUs and GPUs.  Build scripts are provided for each Lagrangian code, and those scripts follow those used in the [MATAR](https://github.com/lanl/MATAR/) GitHub repository. The scripts to build the Lagrangian codes (that use MATAR+Kokkos) are in the scripts folder.  The user must update the modules loaded by the build scripts (for the compiler etc.), and then type
Immediate help with all scripts can be had running
```
source {path-to-repo}/build-fierro.sh --help
```
The default run will build the **full-app** settting up the **Explicit*** solver with **serial** Kokkos for a **linux** computer (non-HPC machine)
Running with ```--help``` option will list all parameters and their accepted arguments
If the scripts fail to build a Lagrangian code, then carefully review the modules used and the computer architecture settings.  
For building on a Mac, please see the extra info in the BUILD.md
#A more lenghtly discussion of the build scripts is provided in the MATAR GitHub repository.

### Updating submodules
The ELEMENTS library and MATAR library can be updated to the newest release using
```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
