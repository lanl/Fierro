  summary:
    LANL's software for simulating quasi-static solid mechanics.
  description:
    Fierro (LANL code number C21030) is a modern C++ code designed to simulate quasi-static 
    solid mechanics problems and transient, compressible material dynamic problems with Lagrangian methods, 
    which have meshes with constant mass elements that move with the material, 
    or with Eulerian methods, which have stationary meshes.
