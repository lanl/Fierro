###
# This file will generate a rectangle mesh
# with 16 elements along each axis, a side length of 1, 
# and with the center of the mesh at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).
#
# Each element will have 4 nodes per side, as indicated by the p_order: 3.
# Higher order meshes are output with in VTK Lagrange connectivity ordering
# and generating high order meshes is only supported with VTK output.
