# This file will generate a 2D arc mesh with 50 elements
# along the radial axis and 50 elements along each arc.
# 
# The mesh covers 1/4 circle (as indicated by the 90 degree angular length)
# and has fills the area from ~0 -> 1.2. The mesh is given an inner radius of 
# 0.01 to prevent all of the nodes from intersecting at 0,0,0.
